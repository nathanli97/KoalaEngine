# Project Koala

**Koala** is custom game engine based on Vk&Python. It uses Vulkan to render scene, and Python to control gameplay.

NOTE Koala is still in early developement.

# Getting Started

By the default, the Vulkan RHI is enabled (And this is the only RHI we supported now). 

Please follow 'Quick Start' to setup your developement environment. Only Windows is supported for now. 

# Quick Start (Windows)
